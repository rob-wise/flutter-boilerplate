# Flutter Boilerplate

This is intended to help bootstrap flutter apps. This currently will use the following resources
to help scaffold out apps in a useful way.
- Go Router for page and context routing
- Provider for simple, straightforward-ish state management. 
- Flutter Secure Storage for secure local device k/v management. 

And we'll glue it together with a simple django API in the backend.
